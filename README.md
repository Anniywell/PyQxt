# PyQxt

## Background

When I want to use global shortcuts, the first thing I think of is QxtGlobalShortcut. But it needs to be compiled, the toolchains needs to be installed, and its python binding is not stable, so I found the [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard).

## Features
- Pure Python
- Cross platform
- Easy
